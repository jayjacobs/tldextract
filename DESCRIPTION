Description: After working with <https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract>
    in python, I wanted the same functionality within R.  The list of top level
    domains are loaded from
    <https://publicsuffix.org/list/effective_tld_names.dat>.  The data is
    stored in the package and may need to updated with the getTLD() function.
